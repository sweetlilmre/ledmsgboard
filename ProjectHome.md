This is an implementation of a USB HID interface to the Dream Cheeky DreamLink USB Message board (http://www.dreamcheeky.com/index.php?pagename=product&pid=52).

This implementation is written in C# and provides a library that allows the user to plot pixels, draw characters etc. on the display making for a cheap display implementation for home projects.
